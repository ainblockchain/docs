<summary>How can I check my MiniEgg's level and activity history?</summary>

Go to the aFan Tiniverse discord server and use this command in the #minieggs channel: `/stats <ainft_name> <ainft_id>`. The AINFT name will have only the MiniEggs option for now and enter your miniegg number (1, 2, ... 100) for the AINFT ID. The spec is the activity history of your MiniEggs recorded on AIN Blockchain. You will be able to see the numbers increase as you play with your MiniEgg.

## MiniEgg+ Guides

<details>

<summary>Playing MiniEgg+</summary>

Your MiniEgg+ will have either a demo egg or a MiniEgg you bought. We will provide an interface to switch the MiniEggs in the future.

#### Button instructions

* There's an on/off toggle on the left side of the MiniEgg+, and 3 main buttons at the front.
* Left button (L)
  * It opens up the menu on the starting screen and is used to navigate the menu.
* Center button (C)
  * Use this button to select screens and options.
* Right button (R)
  * Use this button to cancel or go back.

#### Currently, you can do these activities with your MiniEgg:

1. Give hearts to your MiniEgg
   1. Press L to see the menu, and C to select the heart:heart: emoji. If you went passed the heart, no worries! keep pressing L until you come back to the heart.
   2. On the heart screen, you'll see the number of hearts available and the time left until the next refill. Give your MiniEgg some love:two\_hearts: by pressing C.
   3. If you run out of hearts, you'll need to wait until the next refill, shown at the top of the screen.
   4. If you want to go back to the initial screen, press R.
2. Play lullabies to your MiniEgg
   1. Press L to see the menu, and select the sleepy face:sleeping: emoji.
   2. You can select which dream your MiniEgg will have. Each dream has different background and music and provides different types of experiences to your MiniEgg. The types of XPs you earn may influence the characteristics of your MiniEgg and/or an AI that hatches from the MiniEgg in the future:wink:
   3. Your MiniEgg will wake from the sweet dream after 3 hours. You can check out how many XPs the egg has gained from the dream. This is the sum of the different types of points you earned, and you can see the detailed breakdown on the AIN Blockchain explorer: [https://insight.ainetwork.ai/database/values/apps/miniegg\_plus](https://insight.ainetwork.ai/database/values/apps/miniegg_plus)/\<your egg id>

</details>

<details>

<summary>Connecting to Wi-Fi</summary>

If you're not connected to Wi-Fi, you'll see a Wi-Fi setting screen when you turn your MiniEgg+ on ("Wi-Fi connection failed. Searching other Wi-Fi...").

Choose one from the options and enter the password (_this may be a little tedious, sorry guys_:crying\_cat\_face:)

If you're already connected to Wi-Fi and would like to change it, you can reset it using a script.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Charging batteries</summary>

You can charge your MiniEgg+ by connecting it to a power source with a cable given along with the device.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Inserting another MiniEgg / NFT</summary>

If you buy a MiniEgg, we will insert your MiniEgg into a MiniEgg+ device. We will soon publish a guide so you can buy another MiniEgg and put it in yourself.

For those who want to insert other NFTs (e.g. BAYC) into MiniEgg+ devices, contact [info@ainetwork.ai](mailto:info@ainetwork.ai).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Adding a new game</summary>

New games are on their way! We will provide scripts for downloading them to your device and/or a website where you can more easily connect your device and download games.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Troubleshooting</summary>

#### My MiniEgg+ is stuck in the loading screen :scream:

Please try turning it off and on again with the on/off toggle on the left side of the device. If the problem persists, contact our mods at the [Discord #minieggs channel](https://discord.com/invite/e767UendFs).
