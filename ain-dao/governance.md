# Governance

## Process

1. Discord
   1. Propose new initiatives and make the ideas more concrete in the [#governance](https://discord.com/channels/938909864674082826/938912253586051083) channel.
   2. Note that this stage is informal, and it is not restricted to the specific channel/platform.
2. Forum
   1. Create a proposal on the [forum](https://dao.ainetwork.ai/) using the [template](https://dao.ainetwork.ai/t/template-proposal-template/51) and continue the discussion.
3. Voting Round 1 on Discord
   1. If enough alternatives are considered, and discussions are held, start a voting round on the [#voting](https://discord.com/channels/938909864674082826/975587109073223710) channel. Make sure to provide a link to the forum proposal.
4. Snapshot
   1. If the proposal gets more than 5 votes from the selected roles, it will be promoted to [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/ainetwork.eth) by the Moderators.
5. Voting Round 2 on Snapshot
   1. The 2nd voting round will be anywhere from 3 to 7 days, depending on the project. Anyone with an AIN DAO Membership NFT can cast a vote.
