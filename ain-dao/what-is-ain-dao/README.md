# What is AIN DAO

## Mission

The AIN DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that governs the AI Network ecosystem. Our mission is to build a network that makes AI accessible for everyone to share and collaborate anywhere in the world in real time. We believe collaboration is the future of AI, and together, we will achieve the world’s largest network of GPUs, models, and data.

## Roles

An NFT membership is required to access AIN DAO and participate in its governance. (i.e., decision-making, proposing new initiatives, voting).

We have three roles for our members to choose from based on the individual traits and skills they can use to contribute to the AIN DAO. Members will choose their roles, and depending on the member’s level of expertise, they will be assigned from Level 1 to Level 5 following a level sorting system. I.e., Scholar Level 1, Creator Level 3, etc.

The roles are:

* Captains: 👨⚓🌊 Ahoy! Every ship should have a good captain! Captains are members who can provide resources to AIN DAO, such as RUNO holders, investors, and sponsors.
* Creators: ​🎨​🖼💎​ Drop your best AI Creation! Creators are members of AIN DAO with skills in AI and NFT creation.
* Scholars: ​💻​👨‍💻​ 👩🏻‍🎓 It's all about the Algorithm! Scholars are developers and researchers of open-source AI-related projects (formerly known as Ainizers) and blockchain developers.
* Citizens: 🚶🚶🏾‍♀️🌎 Just passing by! Citizens are non-members who are not skilled enough to take a role but are interested in learning or getting to know more about AIN DAO. Since Citizens are non-members, they will always be considered to be Level 0.
