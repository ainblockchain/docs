# Onboarding & Participation

First off, welcome to AIN DAO! We're honored and pleased that you are interested in taking the journey with us.

> Our mission is to build a network that makes AI easily accessible for everyone to share and collaborate anywhere in the world in real-time. We believe collaboration is the future of AI, and together, we will achieve the world’s largest network of GPUs, models, and data.

### 1. Follow the AI Network's Twitter

### 2. Fill out the application form

We will review and analyze the submission with a cutting-edge algorithm to create a membership NFT representing your personality, skills, and interests!

### 3. Check out your email and membership NFT

Application reviews may take up to 1 month. If you meet the requirements during the evaluation, we will issue an NFT. Please remember to check your mailbox, as we will send the evaluation results via email.

#### Hats (Roles)

There are 3 roles within AIN DAO, and the character's hat in your NFT shows which role you take on.

* Captains have a pirate hat
* Creators have a magician's hat
* Scholars have a graduation cap

Last but not least, all active participants in the AIN DAO Discord are given the "Citizen" role. They don't have hats, but they are as valued community members as others. :purple\_heart:
