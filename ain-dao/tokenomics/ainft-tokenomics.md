# AINFT Tokenomics

Overview

AI Network has developed a model for tokenomics in [AINFT](broken-reference) projects. It focuses on the sustainable growth of the community by providing sufficient rewards to its members – especially the NFT holders – as well as growing the AI Network ecosystem along with the projects'.

### NFT Holder Reward Mechanics

#### Activity Rewards

Users can earn $Token through activities on the project's platforms or other metaverses as part of the profit-sharing system. The treasury will decide how much of the revenue they will share with the NFT holders, buy tokens from the DEX, and deposit the tokens in the reward pool smart contract.

#### "Staking" NFTs

Users can "stake" their NFTs to boost the rewards. Note that the smart contract does not require the users to actually transfer the ownership of their NFTs at any point. They would only need to verify their ownership and select the NFTs to level up. The higher the level of the NFT you own, the more rewards it will earn.

## Relationship with $AIN

One of the key functionalities of this token economy framework is increasing the usage of $AIN. The $Token is listed on a DEX, paired with $AIN, and the treasury buys $Token with the project's profits and distributes $Token to the NFT holders. This way, the success of the AIN ecosystem is coupled with the success of each AINFT project as well.

## Applications

### MiniEggs and $FANCO ([link](https://docs.ainetwork.ai/ainfts/ainft-projects#minieggs-tiniverse-afan))

{% embed url="https://opensea.io/collection/mysterious-minieggs" %}

[The Mysterious MiniEggs!](https://miniegg.afan.ai/) is a collection of 100 mysteriously adorable MiniEggs. It is also a live implementation of the AI Network's token economy model. In the MiniEgg ecosystem, there are [$FANCO](https://etherscan.io/token/0x2f85d45985b92087db8cdbc498609a78c58a967c) ERC20 tokens and MiniEgg NFTs. Its major metaverse platforms include aFan (available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.comcomai.afan), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/afan/id1434385630), and on the [web](https://afan.ai/)), [Tiniverse](https://tiniverse.afan.ai/), and its [Discord](https://discord.gg/dZBg6xA6GC) server. Initially, the profits are shared among the MiniEgg holders equally, but the team is also planning to activate the leveling mechanics, which will reward the holders proportionally to their contributions and activities on the metaverses.
