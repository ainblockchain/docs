# AI Network Tokenomics

## Overview

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/ainetwork_tokenomics (3).png>)

At the center of the AI Network tokenomics is $AIN. $AIN is the token that can be exchanged for decentralized computing power. AI Network obtains GPUs from the resource providers and in exchange, they get $AIN. Applications, such as Ainize and AINFTs, on AI Network, can use computing power and the blockchain as their backends, as well as decentralized storage solutions. They provide services to the users including researchers, developers, and creators. As the applications grow, their $Tokens will grow in value and $AIN as well. Since there are more demands, more resource providers will be willing to supply their GPUs, hence the flywheel spins.
