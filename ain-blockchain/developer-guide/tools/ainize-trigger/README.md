# Ainize Trigger

### Welcome!

This tutorial explains the process of calling the API of a project deployed in Ainize using AI Network Blockchain. Here, we will intro the process of writing down the results from the model after setting the Trigger Function on Blockchain using the API of the model that was fine-tuned (GPT-2) with the novel Pride and Prejudice.

AI Network Blockchain, which can handle large-scale transactions, has been designed to securely record communications between clients as well as sending requests and nodes processing tasks. A more detailed description of AI Network Blockchain can be found [here](https://docs.ainetwork.ai/).

#### You will learn to:

1. Create an App on the AI Network Blockchain and register a Trigger Function through Ainize
2. Use the Trigger Function
3. Write Values on AI Network Blockchain
