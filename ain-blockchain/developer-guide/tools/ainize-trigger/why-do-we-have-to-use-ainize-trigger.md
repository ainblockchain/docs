# Why do we have to use Ainize Trigger?

Those of you who have experienced Ainize Trigger may think, “Why should I call Endpoint through the blockchain if I can send a request directly to Endpoint?” To tell the difference, we need to talk about Web 3.0.

The Internet today does not have an independent state. From the user's point of view, stateless is like using the Internet for the first time in a new browser (without browsing history, autocomplete, favorites, etc.), every time you use the Internet. Imagine you are using the Internet in a new environment every time you use the Internet. It would be very inconvenient.

Cookies were first developed to solve these problems. A cookie is an information file that is recorded on a user's computer through the server that the site uses when a user visits a site. This allows you to save states such as access history, autocomplete, favorites, and more. The problem with cookies, however, is that they are created and controlled by the service provider (the site you visit), not the user. Users do not have access/modification rights to their states.

The second developed method is to manage the user's state on the service provider's central machine. This type of Internet is called Web 2.0. Web 2.0 is the Internet that has been used for the past 20 years, and social networks and content sharing are the basis for this. The most distinctive feature is the emergence of massive, centralized platforms. There are platforms such as Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google, which have billions of states. These are Internet companies that have grown to the point where they can exert great power not only on the Internet but also on society in general.

In this era, the basic direction of Web 3.0 is the decentralization movement to share the states, the online power concentrated in a few large companies, to everyone, without being monitored or being inspected. This can be implemented by blockchain.

If you use blockchain, you can solve the above problems. If you create an app through blockchain, you can manage your own state, and everyone participating in the blockchain can manage and utilize these states, rather than being monopolized by some companies. But in the case of API calls, how can we record states? AI Network allows you to leave a state.

AI Network supports event listeners. When a state is written in the blockchain database, an event listener is triggered to send a POST request to the endpoint registered in advance, and the state value is written to the database. Not only can you manage these states, but other users can also access them. A stateless API (Web 2.0) has changed into a stateful API (Web 3.0)! Therefore, by using Ainize Trigger, you can create your own App on the AI Network, which saves the state so that static information, as well as programs that move, change and react, can also be connected over the Internet!
